# Hotel React Project

Project Overview

This project is a React-based implementation of the Hotel Template cloned from Colorlib. The goal is to transform the static template into a dynamic React application by breaking it down into components and improving various aspects of the website.

Each teammate is responsible for managing specific components and making necessary changes to enhance user experience, fix missing elements, and refine uninteresting parts of the original template.

Team Responsibilities

Each team member will handle specific components, ensuring modularity and maintainability. The project aims to foster collaboration and enhance the website's overall appeal.
